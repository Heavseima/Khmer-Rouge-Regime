                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="extra-bottom">
                        Welcome to an exploration of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, one of the most tragic and devastating periods in modern history. 
                        The Khmer Rouge regime, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, was led by Pol Pot, who sought to transform the country into 
                        a rural, self-sufficient society. In doing so, the regime purged the country of perceived enemies and imposed radical social 
                        and economic changes that resulted in the deaths of millions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This genocide highlights the catastrophic consequences of ideologically-driven regimes and their ability to exploit power, 
                        leaving a profound impact on the lives of those who suffered and shaping the future of Cambodia for generations to come. The 
                        following sections of this project will explore the factors that led to the Khmer Rouge's rise, the policies they implemented,
                        and the lasting legacy of their reign.

                    <h2>War: The Rise of Khmer Rouge</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Khmer Rouge capitalized on regional conflicts and internal instability to gain power in Cambodia. Their rise was deeply tied to the consequences of war and foreign intervention.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Vietnam War Spillover</strong>: As the Vietnam War escalated, Cambodia’s neutrality was violated. The U.S. and South Vietnamese forces frequently crossed into Cambodian territory to target Viet Cong supply routes, destabilizing the country.</li>
                        <li><strong>U.S. Bombing Campaign</strong>: Between 1969 and 1973, the U.S. carried out massive bombing raids in Cambodia, targeting suspected Viet Cong hideouts. These bombings devastated rural areas, killed tens of thousands, and displaced millions, fueling resentment against the government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Civil War</strong>: The chaos created by U.S. intervention and the increasing involvement of Vietnamese communists led to a full-blown civil war between the Cambodian government, led by Lon Nol, and the Khmer Rouge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vietnamese Influence</strong>: The North Vietnamese, supporting the Khmer Rouge as part of their broader communist strategy, provided resources and training, strengthening the insurgents.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These factors weakened Cambodia’s government, destabilized its economy, and turned rural populations against the regime, allowing the Khmer Rouge to present themselves as liberators and gain significant support. By 1975, they seized Phnom Penh and took control of the country.

                    <h2>State Power Under the Khmer Rouge</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Khmer Rouge established an authoritarian state where power was centralized entirely within the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). This control allowed the regime to enforce its radical vision with absolute authority.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Centralized Leadership</strong>: State power was concentrated in the hands of Pol Pot and a small cadre of party leaders. They made all key decisions, bypassing any traditional forms of governance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Abolishment of Institutions</strong>: The Khmer Rouge dismantled all existing state institutions, including the monarchy, judiciary, and local administration, to eliminate opposition and consolidate control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enforcement Through Violence</strong>: State power was maintained through fear, with mass executions, forced labor camps, and widespread surveillance used to silence dissent and eliminate perceived enemies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Control Over Daily Life</strong>: Every aspect of life, from work to food distribution, was managed by the state. Individuals had no personal freedoms, as the regime controlled housing, movement, and even relationships.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This consolidation of state power enabled the Khmer Rouge to impose its radical policies but resulted in widespread oppression, fear, and devastation across Cambodia.

                    <h2>Khmer Rouge Class System</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Khmer Rouge implemented a strict class hierarchy to enforce their vision of a revolutionary society.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The New People</strong>: Urban citizens, intellectuals, and professionals forcibly relocated to rural areas. They were viewed as "enemies" of the revolution and often subjected to brutal labor, starvation, and execution.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Old People</strong>: Rural farmers who were seen as more aligned with the Khmer Rouge’s ideals. They were forced into collective farming but generally faced less severe treatment compared to the New People.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Base People</strong>: Khmer Rouge loyalists from rural areas who were given privileges and trusted with enforcing the regime’s policies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This system created deep divisions within society, favoring rural revolutionaries and punishing those from urban or educated backgrounds. It was a tool of control that led to immense suffering and the systematic destruction of Cambodian culture and life.

                    <p>
                        In 1978, the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea was established to overthrow the Khmer Rouge and end the suffering caused by their oppressive regime. The movement was led by Heng Samrin, a former Khmer Rouge official who defected after witnessing the regime’s atrocities. Vietnam played a crucial role in supporting the Front, providing military assistance, training, and leadership to bolster their efforts. This marked a pivotal moment in Cambodia’s history, as it symbolized both internal resistance and international intervention.

                        <li>Captured Phnom Penh on January 7, 1979, marking the end of Khmer Rouge rule.</li>

                        With the fall of Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge ousted, the Salvation Front established the People’s Republic of Kampuchea, backed by Vietnam. While the movement brought an end to a horrific chapter, it also sparked debates about sovereignty and foreign intervention. Nevertheless, the Salvation Front remains a key chapter in Cambodia’s fight for freedom and recovery.

                            The Khmer Rouge regime which is from 1975 to 1979 marked a profound transformation in Cambodia, moving from a monarchy with colonial influences to an isolated agrarian state under radical rule. Their policies abolished urban life, dismantled educational institutions, and eradicated perceived capitalist elements to forge a "pure" peasant society. The forced displacement, collectivization, and brutal repression left lasting scars, reshaping Cambodian society and impacting the nation's development and trauma that resonate today.

                            The Khmer Rouge took power during a time of Cold War tensions and unrest from the Vietnam War. The Cambodian government was weak after U.S. bombings, which helped the Khmer Rouge rise to power. Their ideas were a mix of radical communism and nationalism, and they wanted Cambodia to be self-sufficient and isolated from the rest of the world. This desire for self-reliance led them to close off the country and reject foreign aid, which worsened the crisis.

                            Several factors caused the rise of the Khmer Rouge, including political chaos, economic problems, and anger over foreign interference. Their goal was to create a classless society by getting rid of people they saw as enemies, like intellectuals and city-dwellers. But this led to mass deaths, starvation, and suffering. The Khmer Rouge's policies of forced labor and extreme punishment created a widespread humanitarian disaster that left the country deeply scarred.

                            Key events, like the Khmer Rouge's partnership with China and their decision to get rid of money, were influenced by specific leaders and circumstances. For example, U.S. bombing made rural people angry, which helped the Khmer Rouge gain support. The Vietnamese invasion in 1978 also played a key role in ending the Khmer Rouge's rule. This invasion, along with internal problems within the regime, led to their downfall and the end of their extreme policies.

                        <p>
                            The Khmer Rouge affected people in different ways. Rural people were forced to work on farms, while city people and intellectuals faced harsher treatment. International reactions were mixed, with some condemning the regime and others, due to Cold War politics, indirectly supporting them. Within Cambodia, some people secretly resisted the regime, showing how individuals found ways to survive under extreme oppression. These responses highlight the complexity of survival and resistance in such a brutal system.
